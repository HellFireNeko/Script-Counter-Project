# Script-Counter-Project
A collection of programs i have worked on that aid in running a tally on the scripts in your projects

To use the script counters, you need to know how to compile them, and the programs only care about script files that corelate to their own language, so the Python one will only tally the python file type, and same with the C++ and C# versions.

Simply create a new C++ or C# project, and import the single code file for those, and the python file can be executed directly if you have the python runtime.
